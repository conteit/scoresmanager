# Scores Manager (scoresmanager)
Utility for managing scores in a challenge/grest and presenting them as a PPT slideshow.

This is a personal project started long time ago and developed for many years. This repository has been recently created in order to start working on it again, perfectioning it and making it available for general use.

The original idea was to use it for keeping track of scores during Grest (Gruppi Estivi). Techinically this project can be used to manage scores in any type of tournament.

## Features
* Manage multiple Grests (tournaments):
  * Set up some players with name, identifying color, avatar
  * Manage scores organized by days and games (partials and penalties)
* Print reports
* Export/Import grests
* Generate a slideshow for showing how the Grest/Tournament is going on
* Easy-to-use GUI for managing the process

## Planned improvements
* Refactor the project in order to make it Maven-based
* Review presentation layer in order to simplify the creation of new slideshows
* Bug-fixing
